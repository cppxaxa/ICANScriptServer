    let toks = tokens(t, "text_en")
    for tok in toks
        filter tok not in ["a", "in", "and", "of", "is", "his", "her", "he", "on", "the", "at", "up", "for", "are", "it", "has"]
        collect token = tok with count into cvar
        
sort cvar, token
let perc = cvar / count(icansee_cam_5) * 100
filter perc <= 2.0
return { "token": token, "count": cvar, "percentage": perc }

and check if any token matches, then alert
